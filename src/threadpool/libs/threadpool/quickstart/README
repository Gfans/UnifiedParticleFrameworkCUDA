Supposing the boost directory is in /usr/local/lib, it is also worth to mention that they need to 
set LD_LIBRARY_PATH as follows: 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(LD_LIBRARY_PATH):/usr/local/lib

Please adapt threadpool.makefile to your system.

Special thanks to Rudy Prabowo who contributed this example to help linux users.
